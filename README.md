# Docx-input-by-Monday-API
This project aims to get the documentation writing process easier, by using simple docx manipulation python librarie to fill the gaps on speccific point on our template.


The way It works its simple:

<strong>1.</strong> By a form in Mondays website, you are supposed to fill in the nescessary information;
<br><br>
<strong>2.</strong>So it will feed a pre-set board, within the information, and trasmit it to the main python code;
<br><br>
<strong>3.</strong>Python will use the Docx librarie to fill the document with the board data;
<br><br>
<strong>4.</strong>And finally upload back to monday the document already finished.
